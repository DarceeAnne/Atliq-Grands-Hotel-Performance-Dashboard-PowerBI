For this project I worked with a data set from AtliQ Grands, a five-star hotel group operating for more than 20 years across India. Recently, AtliQ Grands has been losing market share and revenue, so their revenue team has decided to hire a data analyst to explore some of their historical data to see what insights they can discover and act upon moving forward. The data set covers a three-month period and includes information on 13,500 bookings. To tackle this task, I created a Power BI report with six dashboards: one summary dashboard with key information covering the entire breadth of the data, and five supporting dashboards each with a specific focus, including specific properties, acquisition channels, room categories, time periods, and cities. Underpinning these reports are two fact and four dimension tables and a few dozen calculated columns and DAX measures. Check out my explainer video and the link to the live dashboard to see my work.
